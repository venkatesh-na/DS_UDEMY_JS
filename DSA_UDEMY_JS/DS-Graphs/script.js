-vertex - a node
-edge - connection between nodes

*Type of graph
-undirected graph - a-b  - a can see b content and b can also see a content
-directed graph - a<-b - a cant see b content but b can see a content
-weighted graph -        8   10

                      7
                when we assign a value to its edges it becomes a weighted graph
-unweighted graph - undirected and directed graph are an example of unweighted graph becuase there is no value associtaed to an edge

undirected graph - eg facebook a - b 
directed graph - eg instagram(venkatesh -> justin) venkatesh following to justin but justin is not following to venkatesh even thought i can be possible than a <-> b

Q)is there an edge between 1 and 3?
->at index 1 there is no 3
  at index 3 there is no 1
  sp no there is no edge

*if we have just letter in vertex than we can use adjacency matrix and 
if we have number which s start from 0 and ordered than we can use adjecency list and
if we have a vertex with huge gapes between the numbers and what if there a names in node than ithat case we use hash table(object,dictonaries,maps etc)

-Adjecency list for unordered data of string etc

    a:[b]
    b:[a,c]
    c:[b]

adjacency list                          adjacency matrx
-can take up less space                  Take up more space in sparse graph 
 (in sparse graph(we dont have           (becuase there is less connection
 that many edges))                        between nodes means unncessary zeros)
-faster to iterate all over              -slower to iterate all over edges(becuase 
 edges                                    we are going to traverse throght the edges 
                                          which are not there
-can be slower o lookup                  -faster to lookup specific edge
 specifuc edges                           we dont need to iterate here we can         
(we have to iterate throght               directly access
edges of certain node)
first we have to fidn vertex 
and then iterate through
edges so o(v+e)


we are using adjacency list becuase most of the data in real world are sparse means there are lots of vertices but usualy they are not connected
and 
if your every node is connected to each other throgh edges than use adjacency matrix


//Graph traversal
visiting/updating/checking ecah vertex in a graph

in tree - there is only one way to reach to an leaf
in graph - there is can be more than one ways for one node to other node

graph traversal uses
-peer to peer networking
-web crawlers
-finding closest
-matches/recommendations
-shortest path problem
 -GPS navigation
 -solving mazes
 -ai(shortest path to win the game)

Depth first graph traversal - we go to children of selected node firsr
Breath first graph traversal - we first go an sibling of selected node first
